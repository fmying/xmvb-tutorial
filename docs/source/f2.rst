BDE and RE of F2
==================

.. _Introduction:

Introduction
------------

F2 is a typical diatimic molecule which is simple enough for the users as a starting point.
There is only 1 chemical bonding in the molecule. The 3 structures of the bonding is shown below.

   Structures of F2 molecule

Here ``S1`` denotes the covalent structure in which two active electrons are shared between both F atoms while ``S2`` and 
``S3`` denote 2 quivalent ionic structures in which two active eletrons doubly occupy orbital on certain F atom.

Computations at Stationary Point
---------------------------------

The computations are proceeded with F-F bond length 1.4 Angstrom, and the basis set is cc-pVDZ. For simplicity, F atoms are located in the *Z* axis.

Here shows the XMVB input file for all 3 structures at stationary point:
